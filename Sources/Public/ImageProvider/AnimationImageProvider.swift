/// Image provider is a protocol that is used to supply images to `LottieAnimationView`.
///
/// Some animations require a reference to an image. The image provider loads and
/// provides those images to the `LottieAnimationView`.  Lottie includes a couple of
/// prebuilt Image Providers that supply images from a Bundle, or from a FilePath.
///
/// Additionally custom Image Providers can be made to load images from a URL,
/// or to Cache images.

  /// Whether or not the resulting image of this image provider can be cached by Lottie. Defaults to true.
  /// If true, Lottie may internally cache the result of `imageForAsset`
  var cacheEligible: Bool { get }

  /// The image to display for the given `ImageAsset` defined in the `LottieAnimation` JSON file.
  func imageForAsset(asset: ImageAsset, seconds: CGFloat?) -> CGImage?
